    <h2>CS3220 Lab 6</h2>

    <p>Please deploy your application on CS3, and upload all source files to Canvas. The source files should
        include all the source code and an HTML file <em>lab6.html</em> which contains a hyperlink to your
        application on the CS3 server.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>In this lab you are going to implement an online tool for practicing single-digit additions.</p>

    <p>Create a Dynamic Web Project in Eclipse, then create a servlet called <em>AdditionPractice</em> as follows:</p>

    <p>In <code>doGet()</code>, generate two random numbers between 1 and 9, and display a form that asks the user
        to enter the sum of the two numbers. For example, suppose the two random numbers are 6 and 2, the form should
        look like the following:</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">6 + 2 = <input name="sum" type="text" /> <button>Submit</button></p>

    <p>You can use <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Random.html#nextInt-int-">nextInt(int
            bound) method in Random</a> to generate the random numbers.</p>

    <p>In <code>doPost()</code>, display the correct answer, the user's answer, and tell the user if their answer is
        correct. For example, suppose the user entered the answer 9, the display should be:</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">6 + 2 = 8</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Your answer 9 is incorrect.</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="#">Try Again</a></p>

    <p>Clicking on <em>Try Again</em> should take the user back to the form with two new numbers.</p>

    <p>The difficult part of this exercise is how to get the two random numbers in <code>doPost()</code> in order to
        check the user's answer and display the result. You may be tempted to store them in application scope, but
        that would be a <em>wrong</em> approach. Data in application scope is not only shared by all servlets, it is
        also shared by all users - a major difference between web applications and desktop applications is that a web
        application is used by many users at the same time. If you store the numbers in application scope, one
        user's numbers will be overwritten by another user's, which will cause the application to show wrong
        result for the first user. You can use two browsers to simulate two users to see the effect of this. The proper
        way to do this is to embed the two numbers in the form generated by <code>doGet()</code> using two hidden form
        fields, so they will be submitted to <code>doPost()</code> together with the user's answer. <em>To receive
            full credit for this exercise, you must use this approach.</em></p>
